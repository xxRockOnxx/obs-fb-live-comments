    <h2>Service Providers</h2>

    <p>I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4">
        <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>

        <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>

        <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>

        <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>

    <p>I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it.
